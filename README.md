# Scene-Classification-Using-a-Transfer-Learning-Approach
Scene classification means to determine which scene category the contents of an image belongs to. Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically Residual Networks, have proved to be quite usual for the task of image classification. In this paper, we make use of a pre-trained Residual Network to do scene classification. We carry out three experiments in particular; investigate whether data augmentation techniques can improve classification accuracy, whether decreasing the resolution of an image can help prevent object detectors and whether pooling methods like Average Pooling and Max Pooling can improve classification accuracy and also whether they have the ability to preserve spatial information. Results of these experiments showed that data augmentation techniques can improve classification accuracy, decreasing the resolution of an image does not remove object detectors and that average pooling has the ability to improve performance whereas max pooling does not. We also conclude that average pooling has the ability to preserve some spatial information on scene images.
